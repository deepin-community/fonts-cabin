Description: humanist sans serif font
 The Cabin font comes in 8 styles: Regular, Medium, Semibold, and Bold, with
 their corresponding italics.
 .
 It is inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's typefaces, with a touch
 of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and
 some elements of the geometric sans.
 .
 The weight distribution is almost monotone, although top and bottom curves are
 slightly thin. Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded and optically
 adjusted. The curved stem endings have a 10 degree angle. E and F have shorter
 center arms. M is splashed.
